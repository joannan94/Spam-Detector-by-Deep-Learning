# Spam-Detector-by-Deep-Learning


# Project objective

The mian objective of this project is to understand how can using TensorFlow2 to build SMS spam detection model. Particularly, I will build a binary classification model to detect whether a text message is spam or not (ham). Moreover, I will learn how to implement Dense, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) Deep Learning models in TensorFlow2 Keras API.

I will use Dense text classifier , LSTM and Bi-LSTM and compare these methods in terms of performance and finally select one of them.

# Steps in project

- Loading and exploring the spam data
- Preparing train data and test data
- Text minning by NLP techniques
- Training the spam detection model using the three approaches mentioned above
- Comparing and selecting a final model
- Making prediction to using the final trained classifier to classify the new messages
